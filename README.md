WORR
====

**WORR** is a fork of [Q2REPRO](https://github.com/Paril/q2repro) which in turn
is a fork of [Q2PRO](https://github.com/skullernet/q2pro) which in turn is a fork
of [Quake II](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-2)... forktacular! It is designed to be a
drop-in replacement of the Quake II re-release engine and intended for use
with the upcoming and extensive [Muff Mode](https://github.com/themuffinator/muffmode)-based mod **WORR**.
Future updates may break compatibility with non-**WORR** game modules.

For building **WORR**, consult the `BUILDING.md` file.

For information on using and configuring **WORR**, refer to client and server
manuals available in doc/ subdirectory.
