## Purpose
Advance Q2REPRO with the full functionality of Quake II Rerelease under the WORR banner.

## Rules
- Document significant changes in detail in a new, appropriate document.
- Retain compatibility with legacy Q2 servers and demos; do not break joining legacy servers or playing legacy demos.
- Use idTech3 (Quake 3 Arena) codebases as refactoring inspiration (Quake3e: `E:\_SOURCE\_CODE\Quake3e-master`, baseq3a: `E:\_SOURCE\_CODE\baseq3a-master`) to replicate its advantages as WORR evolves.
- Treat `q2proto/` as read-only unless explicitly prompted otherwise; creating/developing a new WORR protocol is allowed when needed, but must preserve compatibility with legacy Q2 servers and demos.
