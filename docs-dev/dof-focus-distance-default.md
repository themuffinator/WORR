# DoF Focus Distance Default

## Summary
- `r_dof_focus_distance` now defaults to 16.0 world units instead of 0.0.

## Details
- A non-zero default gives the depth of field effect an immediate, consistent focus distance without extra configuration.
- The value can still be overridden by user/server settings as needed.
