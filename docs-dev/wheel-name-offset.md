# Weapon Wheel Name Offset

## Summary
- Weapon wheel item names now use the raised position at all times, not only while the cursor sits in the deadzone.

## Details
- The upward offset applies whenever the wheel is in weapon mode (not the inventory/powerup wheel).
- This keeps the name clear of the center readout even when the selection is outside the deadzone ring.
