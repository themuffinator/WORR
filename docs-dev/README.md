# WORR Development Docs

This directory contains engineering documentation:

- architecture and subsystem notes,
- migration and refactor logs,
- implementation plans and proposals,
- release/build automation details,
- post-change technical writeups.

## Conventions

- New significant technical changes should be documented here.
- Proposal-style docs belong in `docs-dev/proposals/`.
- Renderer-specific investigations can live in `docs-dev/renderer/`.

## User-Facing Docs

User docs are intentionally separated into `docs-user/` and should stay readable for non-engine contributors.
