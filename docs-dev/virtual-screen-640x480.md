# Virtual Screen 640x480 Migration

## Summary
The 2D virtual screen reference is now 640x480 with integer base scaling that
fills the canvas and keeps UI rendering pixel-aligned. The minimum canvas size
and selectable fullscreen modes are clamped to 640x480. HUD and UI rendering
share the same scaling path.

## Virtual Screen and Integer Scaling
- Reference size: `VIRTUAL_SCREEN_WIDTH = 640`, `VIRTUAL_SCREEN_HEIGHT = 480`.
- Base scale `s = max(canvas_width / 640, canvas_height / 480)` is floored to an
  integer before computing virtual dimensions.
- Virtual dimensions are computed with integer division:
  - `virtual_width  = canvas_width / s`
  - `virtual_height = canvas_height / s`

## Minimum Resolution and Mode Lists
- Fullscreen mode parsing rejects modes below 640x480.
- Windowed geometry parsing rejects sizes below 640x480.
- Minimum window sizes are enforced for Windows, SDL, X11, and Wayland.
- Display mode lists generated by Windows and SDL skip modes below 640x480.

## HUD Handling
- Cgame HUD rendering uses the same virtual scaling path as other 2D draws.
- The renderer's 2D scale state applies uniformly across HUD and UI.
