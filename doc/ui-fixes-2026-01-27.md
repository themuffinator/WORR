# UI fixes 2026-01-27

## FPS counter
- Verified `CG_DrawFPS` already uses `fps_scale = 4` for the framerate counter.

## Dropdown sizing
- Added a `DropdownWidget::Height` override so the control height is at least the font line height plus padding.
- Switched the dropdown control box height to use padding-based sizing instead of a fixed +6.
- List row height already uses the padding-aware `RowHeight()` and now aligns with the new control height.

## Scrollbar drag routing
- When an overlay (dropdown/image spin) is open, mouse drag handling now short-circuits before hover updates to avoid selection jitter while dragging.
- Menu scrollbar dragging can now start directly from drag motion on the thumb even if the press event is missed.

## Player config stability
- Guarded player model/skin indices before writing the `skin` cvar on close to prevent crashes when indices are invalid.

## Server list sources
- Added the q2servers raw text list alongside the binary list to include legacy servers in the browser.
