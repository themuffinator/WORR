= Vulkan Renderer Feature Parity Checklist
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

This checklist tracks parity work required for the Vulkan renderer to match the feature set, visual fidelity, and tool support of the legacy OpenGL renderer. Update the *Status* and *Notes* columns as tasks progress.

== Status Legend

* *Complete* — Vulkan implementation matches GL behaviour and has been signed off with regression testing.
* *In Progress* — Work underway; gaps remain or verification pending.
* *Not Started* — No Vulkan work begun; functionality currently missing.
* *Needs Verification* — Implementation believed complete but awaiting QA or comparison capture.

== Rendering Pipeline

|===
| Feature | Status | Notes

| Frame graph sequencing (swapchain, render passes) | Needs Verification | Confirm presentation pacing and synchronization match GL.
| Forward shading path | Needs Verification | Review lighting accumulation and BRDF parity with GL.
| Skybox and environment draw order | Needs Verification | Ensure depth writes and cubemap sampling align with GL output.
| Transparency sorting and blend modes | In Progress | Correct alpha test handling and blended entity order.
| Particle system rendering | In Progress | Vulkan path shares emitter logic but lacks full blend mode parity.
| Decal projection | Not Started | Port GL projected decal shaders and batching.
| Post-processing chain (bloom, color grading, HDR tonemap) | In Progress | Bloom extract ported; tone mapping LUT integration pending.
| UI and HUD overlay pass | Needs Verification | Validate orthographic projection and texture atlas sampling.
| Screenshot capture (PNG/TGA) | Not Started | Implement transfer from swapchain image to CPU buffer.

== Materials and Texturing

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Status | Notes

| Material system (surface params, flags) | In Progress | Descriptors created; per-surface constant parity pending.
| Lightmap combination | Needs Verification | Compare Vulkan lightmap atlas updates with GL streaming path.
| Animated textures (scroll, rotate, scale) | Needs Verification | Confirm UV transform updates per frame.
| Detail textures | Not Started | Requires secondary sampler and blend equation parity.
| Video textures / cinematics | Not Started | Reimplement YUV upload and shader conversion.
| Anisotropic filtering control | Needs Verification | Ensure sampler max anisotropy obeys config.

== Lighting and Shadows

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Status | Notes

| Static lightmaps | Needs Verification | Validate gamma correction and mip bias with GL captures.
| Dynamic lights on surfaces | In Progress | Implement additive light volumes in compute or fragment pass.
| Entity lighting (models, sprites) | Needs Verification | Confirm per-entity constant buffers replicate GL shading.
| Real-time shadow volumes / blobs | Not Started | Port GL stencil workflow or adopt alternative approach.
| Fog volumes | Not Started | Requires shader defines and per-leaf constants.
|===

== Models and Animation

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Status | Notes

| MD3/MD2 static mesh rendering | Needs Verification | Geometry buffers uploaded; confirm pose interpolation.
| Skeletal animation (if applicable) | Not Started | Evaluate for future-proofing even if GL path lacks.
| Vertex morph targets | Needs Verification | Align interpolation weights with GL timers.
| View weapon rendering | Needs Verification | Validate depth bias and hands lighting.
| Sprite billboards | In Progress | Implement Vulkan pipeline state for additive sprites.
|===

== Effects and Post-Processing

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Status | Notes

| Screen-space distortion effects (water warp, heat) | In Progress | Port framebuffer fetch path to subpass input or separate pass.
| Motion blur / camera shake overlays | Needs Verification | Confirm jitter offsets applied equally.
| Color correction & gamma | Needs Verification | Validate swapchain output matches GL gamma controls.
| Damage vignette and overlays | Needs Verification | Ensure blend factors and textures consistent.
| Lens flares / light streaks | Not Started | Recreate additive quad passes.
|===

== Platform Integration and Tooling

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Status | Notes

| Configuration variables parity | Needs Verification | Ensure all `r_*` console variables respected.
| Debug visualization modes (`r_showtris`, `r_lightmap`, etc.) | In Progress | Port GL wireframe and lightmap debug pipelines.
| Renderdoc / validation layer support | Needs Verification | Keep validation clean; document known warnings.
| Hot reload of shaders | Not Started | Implement file watch and pipeline rebuild.
| Headless / dedicated server compatibility | Needs Verification | Confirm Vulkan path gracefully skips rendering.
| Windows platform swapchain | Needs Verification | Validate surface selection, fullscreen toggle.
| Linux platform swapchain | Needs Verification | Verify X11/Wayland integration matches GL stability.

== Performance and Stability

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Feature | Status | Notes

| Performance parity benchmarks | Not Started | Capture reference frametime comparisons per benchmark map.
| Memory usage tracking | In Progress | Add stats for descriptor pools and buffer allocations.
| GPU crash recovery | Not Started | Implement robust resource recreation on device loss.
| CI smoke tests | Not Started | Automate capture comparison across renderers.
|===

== QA Checklist

* Capture GL vs Vulkan frame dumps for each campaign map and compare artifacts.
* Validate networking, input, and gameplay remain unaffected when Vulkan renderer is active.
* Collect user feedback for feature gaps and prioritize remaining *Not Started* items.

Update this document whenever parity milestones are achieved to maintain an accurate project roadmap.
