NAME
----
worrded - enhanced Quake 2 dedicated server


SYNOPSIS
--------
*worrded* [*+command* 'arguments']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This manual page documents briefly the *worrded* program.

WORR is an enhanced Quake 2 dedicated server, fully compatible with original
Quake 2 clients.

WORR dedicated server features multiview demo recording capabilities, game
television support, network protocol optimizations, improved security and
overall performance.


OPTIONS
-------
Commands given on the command line start with a ‘+’, and continue until another
‘+’ or end of line. After command is parsed, it is merely passed to the
internal WORR interpreter, just like if typed directly at the console or read
from config file.

Console variables set on the command line override those given in normal
configuration files. If the variable does not exist as the time it is set, it
is created for future use. User defined variables are permitted.

Some examples of possible commands follow. Complete description of available
internal commands and console variables is given in supplimentary WORR
documentation, and is out of scope of this manual page.

*+set deathmatch 1*::
    Enable deathmatch mode (no monsters, etc).

*+exec config.cfg*::
    Execute the specified configuration file. May be specified more than once.

*+map q2dm1*::
    Spawn the server on the given map.

*--version*::
    Show version and exit.


FILES
-----
*/etc/default/worr*::
    System wide configuration file. The first one to be executed.

*/usr/share/games/worr/*::
    Root of the static Quake 2 game data hierarchy. Non-executable game media
    like textures, models and maps are installed here, either as individual
    files, or in form of uncompressed *.pak* or ZIP compressed *.pkz*
    packfiles.

*/usr/lib/games/worr/*::
    Quake 2 game mod shared libraries are installed here.

*~/.worr/*::
    User's local data hierarchy. Files placed there take precedence over files
    in the system hierarchy. This directory should be writable by WORR user.
    Any dynamic data WORR produces (savegames, demos) are written here.
